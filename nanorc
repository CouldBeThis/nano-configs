set linenumbers

##set mouse does the opposite of what it sounds like.. unsets the mouse. I preffer to 
##leave it toggled off in the nanorc file. 
#set mouse

# Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as 
# the previous line (or as the next line if the previous line is the beginning of a 
# paragraph).
set autoindent

## enable wrapping (softwrap) at spaces and tabs rather than cutting in the middle of a 
## word (atblanks)
set softwrap
set atblanks

set tabsize 4

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.
#set historylog

## Display a "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window.
set indicator

## Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width of the text.  (The color of the stripe can be changed with set stripecolor.)
set guidestripe 72

## Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions. The cursor position is 
## remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files.
set positionlog

## Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.
#set smarthome

## Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for the status bar. 
#set minibar

## Use the top-right corner of the screen for showing some state flags: I when auto-indenting, M when the mark is on, L when hard-wrapping (breaking long lines), R when recording a macro, and S when soft-wrapping. When the buffer is modified, a star (*) is shown after the filename in the center of the title bar. 
#set stateflags

set speller hunspell

## === Key bindings ===

## NETBOOK:
## 	^		=	ctrl
##	M-		=	alt
##	Sh-		=	shift
##	???		=	caps
##	???		=	function keys

##The format of key should be one of:
##  ^X —— where X is a Latin letter, or one of several ASCII characters (@, ], \, ^, _), or the word "Space". Example: ^C.
##    M-X —— where X is any ASCII character except [, or the word "Space". Example: M-8.
##    Sh-M-X —— where X is a Latin letter. Example: Sh-M-U. By default, each Meta+letter keystroke does the same as the corresponding Shift+Meta+letter. But when any Shift+Meta bind is made, that will no longer be the case, for all letters.
##    Fn —— where n is a numeric value from 1 to 24. Example: F10. (Often, F13 to F24 can be typed as F1 to F12 with Shift.)
##    Ins or Del. 

## ctrl + backspace = delete entire word to the left
