## Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions. The cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files. 
set positionlog

## Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.

## Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for the status bar. 
set minibar

## Use the top-right corner of the screen for showing some state flags: I when auto-indenting, M when the mark is on, L when hard-wrapping (breaking long lines), R when recording a macro, and S when soft-wrapping. When the buffer is modified, a star (*) is shown after the filename in the center of the title bar.

## === Key bindings ===

## NETBOOK:
## 	^		=	ctrl
##	M-		=	alt
##	Sh-		=	shift
##	???		=	caps
##	???		=	function keys

##The format of key should be one of:
##  ^X —— where X is a Latin letter, or one of several ASCII characters (@, ], \, ^, _), or the word "Space". Example: ^C.
##    M-X —— where X is any ASCII character except [, or the word "Space". Example: M-8.
##    Sh-M-X —— where X is a Latin letter. Example: Sh-M-U. By default, each Meta+letter keystroke does the same as the corresponding Shift+Meta+letter. But when any Shift+Meta bind is made, that will no longer be the case, for all letters.
##    Fn —— where n is a numeric value from 1 to 24. Example: F10. (Often, F13 to F24 can be typed as F1 to F12 with Shift.)
##    Ins or Del. 

## ctrl + backspace = delete entire word to the left
